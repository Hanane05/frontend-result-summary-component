## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned how to use gradient colors in backgrounds.


```css
button {
  background-image:linear-gradient(0deg, hsl(241, 81%, 54%), hsl(252, 100%, 67%));
}
```


### Continued development

- Mobile first.
- Using variables.
  

### Useful resources
